The first link for reading talks about text editors, their types, the difference between each editor and the other, and that every person can use any editor he wants .There is a difference in opening a terminal depending on the device used, but the matter is very easy and the terminal runs the bash and we can open many commands and perform different tasks at the same time. 

And learn some of the shortcuts that follow to use in the command line: 
pwd: (Print Working Directory) -> command that displays the full path to the current directory (folder).
ls: (list files) -> will list all the files Or folders in your current directory.
mkdir: (make directory) -> Creating a new directory.
cd: (change directory) -> used to change the current working directory.
cd ..  :  will move up one directory
touch -> used to create a file.
clear -> all of your previous commands in the window are cleared
