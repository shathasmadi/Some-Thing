## *Diversity & Inclusion in the Tech Industry*


## What occured during the same time as the beginning of the decline of women in computer sciene?
The share of women in computer science started falling at roughly the same moment when personal computers started showing up in U.S. homes in significant numbers.These early personal computers weren't much more than toys. You could play pong or simple shooting games, maybe do some word processing. And these toys were marketed almost entirely to men and boys.

## Why does it matter that males had been playing on computers growing up?
 This was a big deal when those kids got to college. As personal computers became more common, computer science professors increasingly assumed that their students had grown up playing with computers at home.

## What three take-a-ways do you have looking at this data?

 - the percentage of the working women in tech is lower than men;
 - the white women works more than other race in this field,
 - the top companies have more than half of its employee from women

## When are diversity efforts most successful?
 Diversity efforts are most successful when they’re driven by a commitment from company leaders. And meaningful commitment requires leaders to understand why diversity matters. At Paradigm, we spend a lot of time brainstorming with CEOs and other company leaders about what is or should be driving their diversity and inclusion efforts
### Why do diverse companies perform better?
some of the most successful and innovative companies are not very diverse. Just as the example of a smoker who lives to be 100 does not disprove that smoking is bad for one’s health, anecdotes of companies that have succeeded in spite of homogeneity are not a counterpoint to the overwhelming evidence that diversity makes teams smarter and is linked to positive business outcomes.  
## Give an example of how a diverse company can serve a diverse user base or vise-versa.
When the employees of an organization better represent their users and desired users, they will build more effectively for those groups. When YouTube’s almost entirely right-handed developer team built the iOS app without considering how left-handed people would use it, for example, 5% to 10% of videos were uploaded upside down as a result. This factor may be especially relevant for leaders of consumer tech companies.
