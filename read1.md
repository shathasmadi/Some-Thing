HTML: is used to create web pages
CSS: uses rules to enable you to control the styling and layout of web pages
When you ask your browser for a web page, the request is sent across the Internet to a special computer known as a web server which hosts the website.
All websites use HTML and CSS, but content management systems, blogging software, and e-commerce platforms often add a few more technologies into the mix.
HTML Chapter 1: “Structure” (pp.12-39)
HTML pages are text documents.
HTML uses tags (characters that sit inside angled brackets) to give the information they surround special meaning.
Tags are often referred to as elements.
Tags usually come in pairs. The opening tag denotes the start of a piece of content; the closing tag denotes the end.
Opening tags can carry attributes, which tell us more about the content of that element.
To learn HTML you need to know what tags are available for you to use, what they do, and where they can go.
<meta> : The <meta> element lives inside the <head> element and contains information about that web page. ` description, keywords, robots, author, pragma, expires, ` There are some characters that are used in and reserved by HTML code.
HTML Chapter 17: “HTML5 Layout” (pp.428-451) The<header> and <footer> elements can be used for:
The main header or footer that appears at the top or bottom of every page on the site.
A header or footer for an individual<article> or <section> within the page. <nav> element is used to contain the major navigational blocks on the site such as the primary site navigation.
<article> element acts as a container for any section of a page that could stand alone and potentially be syndicated. <aside> element has two purposes, depending on whether it is inside an <article> element or not. <section> element groups related content together, and typically each section would have its own heading. <hgroup> element is to group together a set of one or more <h1> through <h6>elements so that they are treated as one single heading.
HTML Chapter 18: “Process & Design” (pp.452-475)
It’s important to understand who your target audience is, why they would come to your site, what information they want to find and when they are likely to return.
Site maps allow you to plan the structure of a site.
Wireframes allow you to organize the information that will need to go on each page.
Design is about communication. Visual hierarchy helps visitors understand what you are trying to tell them.
You can differentiate between pieces of information using size, color, and style.
You can use grouping and similarity to help simplify the information you present.
