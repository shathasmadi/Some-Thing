## Add a node after a given value(6 steps)

If you want to add a node after a given value, follow these steps:

1. add a current node that points at the current node and assign it to the head.

2. create a new node for the value

3. then by using while loop and current.next loop through the linked list

4. create a condition to check if the current node is equal to the value

5. first add a reference for the new node to the current node.next

6. then change the reference for the current node to the new node
