# Read: Class 01 Java Basics

## [Java Basics](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/tutorial/java/nutsandbolts/index.html)

- I learned about:

1. Variables
   - Instance Variables (Non-Static Fields): their values are unique to each instance of a class
   - Class Variables (Static Fields): their values will never change.
   - Local Variables
   - Parameters
   - Variable names are case-sensitive
   - begin your variable names with a letter
   - dollar sign character, by convention, is never used
   - use full words instead of cryptic abbreviations
   - If it consists of more than one word, capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word
   - If your variable stores a constant value capitalize every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore character
1. Operators
   - postfix expr++ expr--
   - unary ++expr --expr +expr -expr ~ !
   - multiplicative \* / %
   - additive + -
   - shift << >> >>>
   - relational < > <= >= instanceof
   - equality == !=
   - bitwise AND &
   - bitwise exclusive OR ^
   - bitwise inclusive OR |
   - logical AND &&
   - logical OR ||
   - ternary ? :
   - assignment = += -= \*= /= %= &= ^= |= <<= >>= >>>=
1. Expressions, Statements, and Blocks
   - An expression is a construct made up of variables, operators, and method invocations
   - Statements are roughly equivalent to sentences in natural languages. A statement forms a complete unit of execution
     - expression statements
     - declaration statements
     - control flow statements
   - A block is a group of zero or more statements between balanced braces and can be used anywhere a single statement is allowed.
1. Control Flow Statements
   - Control flow statements, break up the flow of execution by employing decision making, looping, and branching, enabling your program to conditionally execute particular blocks of code.

## [Reddit thread on compiling](https://www.reddit.com/r/explainlikeimfive/comments/233dq5/eli5_what_does_it_mean_to_compile_code/)

1. the compiler (usually another program) takes the program the human wrote, and converts it into the program the computer can understand
