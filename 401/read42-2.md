ِActually I agree with this article and with the google decision for leaving Maven project, if the project has a lack of transparencies Even if there is a lot of profit behind it, anyone shouldn't go through it, Especially with the possibility of using the project for bad, It is better to use AI For the public interest instead of its participation in the arms industry.

## [Cyber-Security of self driving cars](https://phys.org/news/2017-02-cybersecurity-self-driving-cars.html)

Personally, I'm not totally against self-driving cars because it could help people with disability but It hard to trust going in these cars in all places,
But I'm against the cars that need some sort of internet-connectivity for its functionality, because these kinds of cars are susceptible to hackers.
What stuck out to me, the story that about a Tesla driver who trusted totally in his car and passed away.
