 "<" : is less than 
 ">=" : is greater than or equal to

Comparison operators usually retum single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
&& Logical AND
|| Logical OR

SHORT-CIRCUIT EVALUATION
Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition.

Loops :
 

It checks a condition firstly then it will execute the code block as soon as the condition evaluates true, once it gives false then the loop will stop checking/executing.
Types of loops:
For : The condition in this type of looping will be a counter that counts numbers; It will execute the code as many as the counter counts [for (i= 0 Initial value where it have to start from ; i<5 The condition that keeps checking according to itâ€™s value ; i++> The counter and it can be counted incrementally or decrementally)].
While : This type of looping has nothing to do with the counting, as soon as the condition is true the code will be executed.
Do.While : It is pretty much like while instead of executing the statement in the curly braces at least once even if the condition is false.
