Comaparion operators:
 == : is  equal to 
 != : is not equal to
 === : is strict equal to 
 !== : is not strict equal to 
 ">" : is grater than
 "<" : is less than 
 ">=" : is greater than or equal to
 "<=" : is less than or equal to 

Comparison operators usually retum single values of true or false. Logical operators allow you to compare the results of more than one comparison operator.
&& Logical AND
|| Logical OR
! Logical NOT
SHORT-CIRCUIT EVALUATION
Logical expressions are evaluated left to right. If the first condition can provide enough information to get the answer, then there is no need to evaluate the second condition.

Loops :
 

It checks a condition firstly then it will execute the code block as soon as the condition evaluates true, once it gives false then the loop will stop checking/executing.
Types of loops:
For : The condition in this type of looping will be a counter that counts numbers; It will execute the code as many as the counter counts [for (i= 0 Initial value where it have to start from ; i<5 The condition that keeps checking according to it’s value ; i++> The counter and it can be counted incrementally or decrementally)].
While : This type of looping has nothing to do with the counting, as soon as the condition is true the code will be executed.
Do.While : It is pretty much like while instead of executing the statement in the curly braces at least once even if the condition is false.

Comparison AND Logical operators:
Comparison operators :
It compare between a value and what is that value might be to return a single value.
It return either TRUE or FALSE.
Types of these operators :
Is equal to (==) It compares the values not the Data types of these values.
Strict equal to (===) It compares the values and the Data types of these values.
Is not equal to (!=) It checks between two values if one of them is not equal to the other (It has nothing to do with the Datatype).
Strict not equal to (!==) It checks between two values if one of them is not equal to the other including the Datatype.
Greater than (>) It checks if the right value is greater than the left one.
Less than (<) It checks if the right value is grless than the left one.
Greater than or equal (>=) It checks if the right value is greater than the left one or if they both equal.
Less than or equal (<=) It checks if the right value is grless than the left one or if they both equal.
Logical operators :
 

It compares between the results of more than one comparison operator.
It return either TRUE or FALSE.
Types of these operators :
Logical and (&&) If both expressions evaluate as true then the final result will be true.
Logical or (	||	) At least one expression should evaluate to true to get true as a final result.
Logical not (!) It negates the value, If it is true then will turn it into false and verse vice.

A for loop is often used to loop through the items in an array
